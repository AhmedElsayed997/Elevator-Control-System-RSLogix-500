# Elevator-Control-System-RSLogix-500
## Project Summary
This project implements a fully functional control system for a 3-floor elevator using ladder logic
programming in RSLogix Micro Starter Lite. The system allows users to select floors using internal
and external buttons, manages movement between floors based on real-time inputs, and handles
automatic door operations with appropriate safety interlocks.

## System Components
## Inputs:
- Floor call buttons from inside the cabin and at each floor
- Floor position sensors (limit switches for each floor)
- Door closed sensor
- Emergency stop
## Outputs:
- Motor control for upward and downward movement
- Door control (open/close actuators)
